69   Fri Mar 26 06:38:40 +0000 2021  @elonmusk DeFi is different from traditional banking in one major aspect, it is decentralized. In a traditional banking system, people or organizations take loans (borrow) from financial institutions and these institutions give loans (Lend). https://t.co/SNQQQ3Esfo

Elon's companies are working hard to solve some existential threats to humankind. But the original posting faulted him for not solving the hunger issue. It's not in his domain.

113  Fri Mar 26 06:38:58 +0000 2021  @WholeMarsBlog If 500k more cars get made in 2021 the chances are Tesla could grow sales by 750k-1mil in 2022 with a full year of Berlin and Austin ramping production - especially Cybertruck. And China making Model2.\nThat's my view at least.                                                                                                                                                 
114  Fri Mar 26 06:38:59 +0000 2021  @Tesla @elonmusk @EPavlic @MinimalDuck @_better_e A question on my mind is; are those chargers easy to upgrade in the future? I mean, its still a super fast evolving car, its still possible that the way of charging and maybe even the plugs, are going to change over the years.                                                                                                               
115  Fri Mar 26 06:38:59 +0000 2021  @brandonee916 There are two groups of people - those who think FSD will never happen and those who think it is easy and why Tesla is so slow on developing it. Only people who works in software development especially in complex projects with AI knows how hard it is. But it is possible.

While you all may admire his success, stay calm and think twice... not to gamble when money is just enough for food!!!
