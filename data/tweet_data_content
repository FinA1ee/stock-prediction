@JaumeBassObiols @MeteoBarrufet No √©s comparable. SpaceX funciona diferent a la resta de industria espacial. Fa servir un sistema de desenvolupament diferent basat en la r√†pida prova i error. De moment s'ha demostrat que √©s un bon sistema amb la s√®rie Falc√≥n. Veurem amb la Starship. De moment no hi ha color.
